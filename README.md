# Exploratory Data Visualization of Yelp Dataset

This project introduces various data visulization techniques with an example of Yelp dataset.


### Objective
Yelp has become a great helper in our daily life, as people are searching for restaurants everyday using this application. By choosing a level of stars and leaving a review, users can evaluate their experiences in different restaurants and share it with others. Therefore, it makes our lives more convenient when looking for great restaurants. This project explores the difference among restaurants in terms of distinct regions and level of stars, along with the relationship between review and quality of restaurants.
